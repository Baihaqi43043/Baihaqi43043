I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer with 2+ years of experience, crafting everything from sleek frontends to robust backend systems. My toolkit includes Laravel, Redis, JavaScript, Python, TensorFlow, Docker, MySQL, Apache, Node.js, and Next.js. Healthcare tech particularly excites me, where I've developed systems from prescription management to patient visit tracking. I thrive on technical challenges and believe in building solutions that are both beautiful and bulletproof. Whether it's architecting databases or polishing user interfaces, I deliver code that's as reliable as it is elegant.
